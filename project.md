# Project Proposal (Initial)

**Title:** Machine Learning Deployment Platform on Chameleon

**Name:** Chandra Shekhar Pandey

**Net ID:** cp3793

**N Number:** N16321363

**Objective:** In today's data-driven world, organizations require advanced AI and machine learning capabilities to gain a competitive edge. Public cloud providers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), offer robust solutions such as Amazon SageMaker, making it easier to deploy machine learning models. However, these services are not available on Chameleon. This project aims to create a machine-learning deployment platform on Chameleon Cloud which offers some of the services provided by AWS SageMaker.

### Different services to be worked upon and the time needed to implement them:

1. **Requirement gathering (4.5 hours):**
   - Collect all the resources needed for the completion of the project.

2. **Model Training (4.5 hours):**
   - Set up all the major machine learning libraries which can be accessed easily without any installation issue.

3. **Model Deployment (4.5 hours):**
   - Set up Docker and Kubernetes for deployment and scaling of the application or models.

4. **Visualization (4.5 hours):**
   - Set up TensorBoard for visualization of the models and the graphs.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning (4.5 hours):**
   - Set up Optuna, an open-source hyperparameter optimization framework for machine learning models.

6. **Experiment Tracking and Versioning (4.5 hours):**
   - Set up MLflow, an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including experiment tracking and model versioning.

7. **Optimizing Inference (13.5 hours):**
   - Set up TensorRT for faster inference on GPU for different available deep learning models.
   - Set up Neural magic tools for faster inference on CPU (More research needed on different open-source libraries).

8. **Inference Serving (4.5 hours):**
   - Set up KFServing, an open-source project that extends Kubernetes for deploying, serving, and managing machine learning models.

9. **Testing End to End (4.5 hours):**

10. **Report writing (4.5 hours):**
